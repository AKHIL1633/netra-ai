# NETRA-AI: National Enhanced Tracking and Real-time Analytics

NETRA-AI is a high-performance, AI-driven surveillance system designed for real-time suspect triangulation. This dashboard is tailored for the Delhi Police "Safe City" vision, providing a unified operational picture for tracking targets across city-wide camera grids.

## 🏛 Vision and Mission

- **Shanti (Peace):** Preventing crime through AI-enabled behavioral analysis.  
- **Seva (Service):** Rapid response through integrated PCR unit dispatch.  
- **Nyaya (Justice):** Maintaining tamper-proof audit logs for investigative integrity

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
Backend: FastAPI (Python), WebSockets for real-time data streaming
Logic: SVG-based trajectory mapping and AI confidence scoring

## 🚀 Installation Guide

## 1. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```
Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:

- **Mac/Linux:** `source .venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows:** `.venv\Scripts\activate`

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server:

```bash
python main.py
```
## 2. Frontend Setup (React and Vite)

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at: http://localhost:5173


## 🛡 Security and Audit Features

- **Audit Logs:** Every action like a mission reset or alert acknowledgment is recorded with a timestamp.
- **RBAC Logic:** Distinct permission levels for Admin, Officer, and Viewer roles.
- **Gov-Ready Architecture:** Optimized for deployment within secure, air-gapped government networks.
